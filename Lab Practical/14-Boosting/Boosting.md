### Differences Between Types of Boosting Algorithms

| **Aspect**                | **AdaBoost**                          | **Gradient Boosting**                  | **XGBoost**                                 | **LightGBM**                              | **CatBoost**                              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Base Learner**          | Decision Stumps                      | Decision Trees                         | Decision Trees                             | Decision Trees                            | Decision Trees                            |
| **Weighting Strategy**    | Misclassified samples get higher weight in subsequent iterations | Optimizes a loss function by gradient descent on residuals | Similar to Gradient Boosting but optimized with regularization | Similar to XGBoost but uses histogram-based splitting | Similar to Gradient Boosting with categorical feature support |
| **Speed**                 | Relatively slow due to sequential nature | Moderate                              | Fast (supports parallelism)                | Very fast (optimized for speed and memory) | Moderate                                 |
| **Memory Usage**          | Low                                  | Moderate                              | Moderate                                   | Low                                      | Moderate                                  |
| **Handling of Overfitting** | Susceptible; requires regularization | Regularization through tree depth or learning rate | Strong regularization via L1/L2 and shrinkage | Good with early stopping and regularization | Regularization and automatic feature tuning |
| **Scalability**           | Not ideal for large datasets         | Moderate scalability                   | High scalability                           | Excellent scalability                     | Moderate scalability                      |
| **Categorical Features**  | Requires one-hot encoding            | Requires one-hot encoding              | Requires one-hot encoding                  | Handles directly                         | Handles directly                          |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning** | Simple                              | Requires tuning (e.g., learning rate, tree depth) | Complex (many parameters)                  | Simple (fewer parameters than XGBoost)    | Simplified tuning process                |
| **Regularization**        | None                                | Implicit (tree depth, learning rate)   | Explicit (L1/L2 penalties)                | Implicit (leaf-wise growth)               | Implicit                                 |
| **Parallel Processing**   | No                                  | Limited                               | Yes                                       | Yes                                      | Limited                                  |
| **Best Use Cases**        | Small, clean datasets                | Moderate-sized datasets with some noise | Large, high-dimensional datasets          | Large datasets with high performance needs | Datasets with categorical features       |
