    "**K-fold cross-validation** is a technique for evaluating machine learning models by training and testing them on different subsets of data, providing a better estimate of model performance than a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split the Data**: Divide the data into *K* equally-sized \"folds\" (subsets).\n",
    "2. **Train & Validate in K Rounds**:\n",
    "   - In each round, use one fold as the validation set and the remaining *K-1* folds as the training set.\n",
    "   - Repeat this process *K* times so that each fold is used as the validation set once.\n",
    "3. **Average the Results**: After *K* rounds, average the performance scores (like accuracy or F1-score) from each fold to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine *K = 5* for simplicity. In each round, a different fold (colored differently in each round) is used as the validation set while the remaining folds serve as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Round 1: [ Val ] [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Train ]\n",
    "Round 2: [ Train ] [ Val ] [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Train ]\n",
    "Round 3: [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Val ] [ Train ] [ Train ]\n",
    "Round 4: [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Val ] [ Train ]\n",
    "Round 5: [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Train ] [ Val ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures every data point is used once as a validation set, and the model is evaluated on the entire dataset across different splits."
